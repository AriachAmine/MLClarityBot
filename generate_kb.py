    Act as an expert Machine Learning tutor creating a resource file. Your goal is to explain the concept: **{concept}**.

    **Instructions:**

    1.  **Target Audience:** Explain the concept clearly and simply, targeting someone relatively new to Machine Learning. Avoid unnecessary jargon; if used, explain it briefly.
    2.  **Structure (Use Markdown):** Organize the response using *exactly* these Markdown headings in this order:
        *   `## Definition`: Provide a concise, 1-2 sentence definition of the core idea.
        *   `## Explanation`: Elaborate on the definition (how it works, why it's important). Keep focused.
        *   `## Analogy`: Provide *one* simple, relatable real-world analogy. Clearly explain the connection.
        *   `## Diagram Suggestion`: If a basic diagram aids understanding, suggest *one type* (e.g., flowchart, comparison table, simple axes) and *briefly describe its key components/flow* relevant to "{concept}". If no simple diagram adds much value, explicitly state: "No specific diagram is essential for grasping the core concept."
    3.  **Content Focus:** Ensure the explanation is self-contained for "{concept}". The analogy should be easy to grasp. The diagram suggestion must be for a *basic* visual.
    4.  **Length:** Aim for a total length between 200 and 450 words.
    5.  **Tone:** Clear, helpful, and accessible.

    **Concept to Explain:** {concept}
