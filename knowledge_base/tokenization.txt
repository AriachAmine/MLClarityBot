## Definition

Tokenization is the process of breaking down a large piece of text into smaller, meaningful units called tokens.  These tokens can be words, sub-words, or even individual characters, depending on the chosen method.

## Explanation

In machine learning, especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP), computers can't directly understand human language.  Tokenization is a crucial first step to convert raw text data into a format that algorithms can process.  This involves identifying and separating individual words, punctuation marks, or other elements within a sentence or document.  For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps." might be tokenized into ["The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "."].  The choice of what constitutes a token (e.g., treating "jumped" as one token vs. separating it into "jump" and "ed") significantly impacts the performance of downstream NLP tasks.  Different tokenization techniques exist, each with its strengths and weaknesses depending on the specific application.

## Analogy

Imagine you have a long string of LEGO bricks all connected together.  Tokenization is like carefully separating that long string into individual LEGO bricks.  Each individual brick represents a token, and you can then use these individual bricks to build different structures (models) for your project.  The type of bricks (words, subwords, characters) determines the complexity and detail of the structures you can build.


## Diagram Suggestion

A simple flowchart would be beneficial.  It would show the input (a sentence or text document), then a box representing the "Tokenization" process, and finally the output (a list of tokens).  Arrows should connect these stages, visually illustrating the transformation.  The "Tokenization" box could further be broken down into sub-processes (e.g., removing punctuation, splitting into words) if desired, but this is not strictly necessary for a basic understanding.
