## Definition

A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical model that explains observable events as a result of hidden, unobservable states.  It uses probabilities to predict the most likely sequence of these hidden states given the observed data.

## Explanation

HMMs are powerful tools for modeling sequential data where the underlying process isn't directly visible.  They consist of three key components:

1. **Hidden States:** These are the unobservable variables that drive the system.  Think of them as the internal "state" of something.  For instance, in speech recognition, a hidden state might be a phoneme (a basic unit of sound).

2. **Observations:** These are the things we *can* observe.  In speech recognition, these would be the actual sound waves.  The observations are probabilistically linked to the hidden states â€“ a particular phoneme is more likely to produce certain sound waves than others.

3. **Transition and Emission Probabilities:**  Transition probabilities define the likelihood of moving from one hidden state to another. Emission probabilities define the likelihood of observing a particular output given a specific hidden state. These probabilities are learned from training data.

HMMs work by using algorithms like the Viterbi algorithm to find the most probable sequence of hidden states that could have generated the observed sequence.  This allows us to make inferences about the underlying process even though we can't directly see it.  This is particularly useful in applications like speech recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and bioinformatics.


## Analogy

Imagine a friend who only ever tells you about their day using weather descriptions ("sunny," "cloudy," "rainy"). You never actually see the weather yourself.  Your friend's mood (happy, neutral, sad) is the *hidden state*. The weather descriptions are the *observations*.  You can learn to infer their mood based on the weather reports.  A sunny day might make them more likely to be happy, while a rainy day might make them more likely to be sad.  The probabilities of mood changes (e.g., from happy to sad) and of reporting specific weather given a mood are the *transition* and *emission probabilities*, respectively.  An HMM would help you guess your friend's most likely mood sequence over several days, given their weather reports.

## Diagram Suggestion

A simple state diagram would be helpful.  It would show circles representing the hidden states (e.g., Happy, Neutral, Sad).  Arrows between the circles would represent transition probabilities (e.g., the probability of transitioning from Happy to Neutral).  From each state circle, arrows would point to a box representing observations (e.g., Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy), with associated emission probabilities shown next to those arrows.  This visualizes the probabilistic relationships between hidden states and observable outputs.
