## Definition

Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to address the vanishing gradient problem often encountered in traditional RNNs.  They achieve this through the use of "gates" that control the flow of information, allowing for better long-term memory.

## Explanation

Standard RNNs struggle to remember information from long ago in a sequence because the gradients used during training diminish over time. GRUs mitigate this by using "gates" â€“ mechanisms that selectively decide what information to keep or forget. These gates are essentially learned weights that determine the influence of past information on the current state.

A GRU has two key gates: the update gate and the reset gate.  The update gate decides how much of the previous hidden state to keep and how much of the new information to add. The reset gate determines how much of the previous hidden state to ignore when calculating the current hidden state.  This careful control of information flow allows GRUs to maintain relevant information over longer sequences, making them effective for tasks like machine translation and speech recognition.  The process involves combining the previous hidden state and the current input to update the hidden state, which then informs the output.

## Analogy

Imagine you're writing a story.  A regular RNN is like trying to remember every detail of the plot from the beginning, which becomes increasingly difficult as the story grows. A GRU is like using sticky notes to highlight key plot points.  The update gate decides which sticky notes to keep and which to discard, while the reset gate helps decide which details on the sticky notes are important to focus on when writing the next part. This system ensures you don't forget crucial information as the story unfolds.

## Diagram Suggestion

A simple flowchart would be helpful.  It would show the input at time t, the previous hidden state (h<sub>t-1</sub>), and the two gates (update gate and reset gate) operating on these inputs.  The flowchart would then illustrate how the gates influence the calculation of the candidate hidden state and the final updated hidden state (h<sub>t</sub>), which is then passed to the next time step.  Finally, an output (y<sub>t</sub>) would be derived from the updated hidden state.  The arrows would represent the flow of information, clearly indicating the role of each gate in the process.
