## Definition

Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression that addresses the problem of multicollinearity (when predictor variables are highly correlated) by adding a penalty term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) cost function. This penalty shrinks the regression coefficients, improving the model's generalization ability and reducing overfitting.

## Explanation

In ordinary least squares regression, we aim to find the line (or hyperplane in multiple dimensions) that best fits the data by minimizing the sum of squared errors. However, when predictor variables are highly correlated, small changes in the data can lead to large changes in the estimated coefficients, making the model unstable and prone to overfitting.  Overfitting means the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.

Ridge regression tackles this by adding a penalty term to the OLS cost function. This penalty is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients.  The strength of this penalty is controlled by a hyperparameter called lambda (λ). A larger λ leads to stronger shrinkage of the coefficients, resulting in a simpler model with potentially lower variance (less overfitting) but possibly higher bias (less accurate fit to the training data).  Finding the optimal λ often involves techniques like cross-validation.

## Analogy

Imagine you're trying to bake a cake using a recipe with many similar ingredients (like different types of sugar).  Ordinary least squares regression is like trying to find the *perfect* amount of each ingredient based on a few past attempts. If some ingredients are very similar (multicollinearity), even small changes in your measurements (data) can dramatically affect the final cake (model prediction).

Ridge regression is like deciding to use slightly less of each similar ingredient.  You might not get the *absolute best* cake possible (slightly higher bias), but you're less likely to have a disastrous result due to slight measurement errors (reduced variance). The amount you reduce each ingredient by is controlled by the "lambda" – the more you reduce (larger lambda), the simpler and more robust the recipe becomes.

## Diagram Suggestion

A simple 2D scatter plot would be helpful.  The plot should show the data points, the OLS regression line (potentially showing its steep slope due to multicollinearity), and a ridge regression line (showing a less steep slope due to coefficient shrinkage).  Label the lines clearly and indicate the effect of the lambda parameter on the slope of the ridge regression line.  This visual comparison clearly illustrates how ridge regression reduces the impact of correlated predictors.
