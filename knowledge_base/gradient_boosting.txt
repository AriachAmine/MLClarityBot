## Definition

Gradient Boosting is a powerful machine learning technique that combines multiple weak prediction models (typically decision trees) to create a strong predictive model. It does this sequentially, with each new model correcting the errors made by the previous ones, focusing on the instances where the previous models performed poorly.

## Explanation

Imagine you're trying to predict house prices.  A simple model might just use the size of the house.  This will be inaccurate because price depends on many other factors (location, age, features, etc.). Gradient Boosting starts with a simple model (e.g., a small decision tree predicting price based solely on size). It then analyzes the errors this model makes.  The next model is trained to specifically correct those errors, focusing on the houses where the first model was significantly off.  This process repeats, adding more models that progressively refine the predictions.  Each new model is a "boost" to the accuracy, focusing on the "gradient" (the direction of the steepest ascent of error).  The final prediction is a weighted average of all the individual models, with more accurate models having a larger weight.  This ensemble approach often leads to highly accurate predictions.

## Analogy

Think of a group of archers trying to hit a target. The first archer takes a shot, and it's not perfectly centered. The second archer observes the first archer's shot and aims to correct the error, landing closer to the bullseye.  Each subsequent archer builds upon the previous shots, aiming to hit the remaining error.  Gradient Boosting is similar: each model is like an archer, trying to improve the overall accuracy by focusing on the remaining error.  The final, combined result is much more accurate than any single archer's shot.

## Diagram Suggestion

A simple flowchart would be helpful.  It could show:

1. **Start:**  Initial weak model is trained.
2. **Calculate Residuals:** The errors (residuals) between the predictions of the current model and the actual values are calculated.
3. **Train New Model:** A new weak model is trained on the residuals.
4. **Combine Models:** The new model is added to the ensemble, weighted based on its performance.
5. **Repeat:** Steps 2-4 are repeated until a stopping criterion (e.g., maximum number of models or sufficient accuracy) is met.
6. **Final Prediction:** The weighted average of all the models' predictions is the final output.

This flowchart visually represents the iterative and additive nature of the Gradient Boosting algorithm.
