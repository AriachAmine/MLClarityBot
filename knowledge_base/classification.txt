## Definition

Classification in Machine Learning is a supervised learning technique where an algorithm learns to assign data points to predefined categories or classes.  It predicts the class label of new, unseen data based on patterns learned from labeled training data.

## Explanation

Classification algorithms work by analyzing features (characteristics) of the input data to identify patterns that distinguish between different classes.  The algorithm learns these patterns during a training phase, where it's fed examples with known class labels.  Once trained, the algorithm can then classify new data points by comparing their features to the learned patterns and predicting the most likely class.  The accuracy of a classification model depends on the quality and quantity of the training data, as well as the chosen algorithm.  Different algorithms are better suited for different types of data and problems; some handle complex relationships better than others.

## Analogy

Imagine a botanist trying to classify different types of flowers.  They examine features like petal shape, color, and number of leaves. Over time, they learn to recognize patterns that distinguish roses from tulips from lilies.  This is analogous to a classification algorithm learning from labeled examples (flowers with known types) to predict the type of a new, unseen flower based on its features.  The botanist's expertise corresponds to the algorithm's learned model.

## Diagram Suggestion

A simple flowchart would be helpful.  It would start with "Input Data (with features)," proceed to "Trained Classification Model," then branch to different output "Class Labels" (e.g., "Rose," "Tulip," "Lily").  Arrows should indicate the flow of data through the model.  The flowchart visually represents the process of inputting data, applying the trained model, and receiving a class prediction as output.
