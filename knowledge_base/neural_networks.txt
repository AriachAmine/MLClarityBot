## Definition

A neural network is a computational model inspired by the human brain's structure. It's a system of interconnected nodes ("neurons") organized in layers that learn to identify patterns and make predictions from data.

## Explanation

Neural networks learn by adjusting the connections (weights) between neurons.  Each connection has a numerical weight that represents the strength of the connection.  Data is fed into the input layer, processed through hidden layers where complex computations occur, and finally produces an output in the output layer.  The network "learns" by adjusting these weights based on the difference between its predictions and the actual values (this is called training).  The goal of training is to minimize this difference, improving the accuracy of the network's predictions. This process often uses algorithms like backpropagation, which iteratively refines the weights to improve performance.  The more data the network is trained on, the better it generally becomes at making accurate predictions.  Different architectures of neural networks exist, each tailored to specific tasks, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and more.

## Analogy

Imagine a team of experts (neurons) each specializing in a specific aspect of identifying a bird.  The input (image of a bird) is shown to the team. Each expert (neuron) examines a particular feature (color, shape, beak size). Their individual assessments (weighted connections) are combined and passed to other experts who further analyze the information.  Finally, a lead expert (output layer) integrates all findings to identify the bird's species. The team's accuracy improves as they learn from more bird images and refine their individual assessments (adjusting the weights of their connections).

## Diagram Suggestion

A simple layered diagram would be helpful.  It should show three layers: an input layer (with nodes representing input features), one or two hidden layers (with nodes representing intermediate computations), and an output layer (with nodes representing the prediction).  Arrows should connect nodes between layers, indicating the flow of information and the weights associated with each connection.  The diagram should visually represent the interconnectedness and flow of data through the network.
